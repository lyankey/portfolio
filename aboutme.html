  <h3 class="margin">My History</h3>
  <p>My kindergarten teacher predicted that I would grow up to be a criminal. My high school career counselor told me to become a mortician. Instead, I ended up getting paid to watch paint dry at Behr Process Corporation. I assure you, it's fascinating if you know what to look for - but not fascinating enough for a lifetime. I became a public-school teacher. In contrast to the world of paint, teaching six-year-olds turned out to involve significantly more bodily fluids than I had envisioned. My frustration with public schools grew big enough for a lifetime. I began law school with the goal of advocating for educational reform, but graduated and found my niche at a non-for-profit clinic practicing immigration law. I did a lot of speaking, wrote a lot of articles, and published a book. During that time, out of necessity, I began a lot of tech projects - too many small things to list. There are so many areas in our lives that are affected by tech, and it's growing all the time.

  I was always wanting to learn more coding, but was always busy, and then, something happened - remember that time in 2020 when we shut everything down and it was like the world stopped? Well, immigration shut down, too. I saw it as my chance to dig in and study anything I wanted. I focused on tech. I completed a lot of tech courses on Udemy and I found out that I really love data science and coding. When the shutdown stretched on, I finally had the chance to go to Software Development Bootcamp at Eleven Fifty Academy.

  <p>I also homeschool my three children. I'm their biggest fan, and they're my biggest fans. I've been actively involved with volunteering in the homeschool world. I'm very passionate about the fact that every child deserves a great education.

  <p> In my spare time, for fun, I write very clean romance novels under a very fake name. Yes, I have a ridiculous amount of drive and energy, but it's just me.

  <p>I've done a lot of things in my life, but one thing unites everything - I'm a problem-solver. I like to make good things happen.

  <h3 class="margin">Why Solve Problems?</h3>
  <p>I come from a long line of people who made things happen. I mean, they were small things. Nothing you'd read about in a history book. Just things. My people come from nothing and they had a lot of problems to solve. Both of my parents were homeless at least once during childhood, and both of my husband's parents were also homeless at least once during childhood. I guess you can never have nothing because you'll always have problems. I currently consider myself to be quite blessed in many ways, but I suppose I'll always like having problems to work on. It's just that some problems are more fun than others, and some have higher stakes.
